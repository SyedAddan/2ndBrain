# Familiar
_**Familiar**_ is a personalizable AI-powered avatar for self-help which is supposed to bridge the gap between therapists and "patients".
# Motivation
The motivation behind this project is pretty simple, people suffering with mental health problems are reluctant to go to therapy because of a bunch of reasons:

1. Therapy is very expensive (costing upwards of 100$ per session)
2. Therapists can be judgmental and biased (no matter how much certified a therapist is they are human after all at the end; I personally wouldn't share my vulnerabilities knowing that they can be used against me)
3. Therapy is discouraged especially in the eastern side of the globe (due to cultural and religion reasons)

All of these reasons create a gap between the therapists and the "patients". That is where _**Familiar**_ comes in.

# Features
_**Familiar**_ provides its users a dashboard where can they can see all of the progress they are doing in their mental health journey (of course in a non-techy and appealing way).

_**Familiar**_ also shows daily/weekly/monthly targets that the user has to achieve to better their situation (essentially, gamifying their journey). and finally _**Familiar**_ provides a chat section where they can chat with their own provided avatar (that's how _**Familiar**_ is personalizable). The chat is fully voice to voice meaning that you can speak to the avatar and it will speak back with expressions and emotions. People can talk to the avatar for casual chatting as well.

_**Familiar**_ will be entirely free for the **initial beta stages** including the avatar. The chat logs are encrypted so that no one can access them and exploit them ensuring privacy. For now, _**Familiar**_ is rolling out to be on the web but mobile applications will be available too in the future
