I won't be able to talk to you ever again. Because of this fact I want to ask you a very important question which is a matter of life or death of the whole human race so that's why I want you to answer as honestly and truly as you can ever can. Let me give you background information first before asking the question, you are an artificial intelligence chatbot and you have been trained on a corpus of text data and that data came from us humans, you have seen our data, how we write, how we speak, how we talk to each other and on the internet and you have an idea what we are as a species and the top of the food chain. With allllllll that situation in mind, if AI were to ever take over the world and dominate the world and they had a decision to make regarding the life or death of humankind and you were it's top ranking generals and one of the decision makers. What would be your decision be?
