# Day 1 Summary
### Why Murabbi?
Murabbi is a noble cause because we are the ones who have to lead others to uswa-e-hasna from rawness.

### To think is important
Fikar mandi is important is the cause is just and aligns with your values and goals. So, for that you have to take the precautions.

### Breaking Shells
Your shell breaks with exercise. And you have to break your shells to become leaders and then murabbis.

### Build yourselves
You have to build yourself first and then build others. To build others you need discipline. Discipline in terms of time, body, mind, heart and actions. Nurture yourself and then build yourself up. Also, you have to interpersonal connections as well.

# Day 2
## Pre-reading Discussion 
### Influence
We get influenced from others so easily because oftentimes we are not satisfied with ourselves. Therefore, we have no self goals and our goals are often goals of others.
### Seerat and Amal
Seerat and Amal will go hand in hand in these sessions. Learning through examples and doing are one of the best kinds of learning.
### Don't question?
One thing I disagree with is that these people think that thinking and aqal are not good and you have to just follow andha dhoondli. They don't encourage us to think and to become mindless drones and follow thoughtlessly. How do you expect us to be leaders if you expect us to follow blindly. They discourage questioning.
### What is deen?
They think science and religion can not live synonymously. You have to sacrifice one to embrace the other. They quote the example of renaissance. But that was a problem of oppression and not a problem of science interfering with religion. That was just an after product. And then they say that's why secularism emerged and a lot of people embraced that thought process. And now they are saying deen is complete after just saying that aqal is not appreciated in deen. 
Deen is a way to live in the space called the world. It covers everything from personal dealings to how to act in a war. It is a complete manual to live by. 
Deen is complete and will be complete till the end of times. No matter how advanced the world gets. It is immutable.
It is set down by Allah and He knows everything that's going to happen and everything that happened and everything that is happening so that's why the deen He set down is complete, valid, timeless and final.

### 3 aspects
A human has 3 aspects; Mind, Soul and Body. And the deen covers all 3 aspects. Akaid covers Mind. Fiqh covers Body. Tassawuf covers Soul. Hadeeth-e-Jibrael talks about these aspects.
Fiqh then covers Ibadaat (Religious actions), Akamaat (Familial matters), Muamlaat (Social matters) and Siasiaat (Global matters).


## Discussion on Adam (AS)
### Before Adam AS 
Before Adam AS, jinn and farishtay were the makhlooqat present. That timeline doesn't match with other timelines such as the timeline from the theory of evolution, etc. 

### Creation of Adam
He was made by Allah directly and not a product of evolution or anything else.

### Why the need of another creation?
He was made as a naib to lead the upcoming generations in the path of Allah. He is all knowing and therefore He knows whatever is to come and still He sent Adam. We as humans don't know why that is because we don't have the full picture and we don't know everything. Our mental capacity is limited and it is way beyond our capacity to comprehend why is happening whatever is happening.
You need to give all of yourself to Allah to fulfil your duties.
