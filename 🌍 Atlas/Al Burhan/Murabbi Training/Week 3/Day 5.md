# Taqwa
The feeling (kaefeeat) to follow Allah's orders and fear Him.
## How to acquire it?
It is a feeling that is acquired by being close to the people who are close to Allah. How to identify them? Whoever seems to be close is probably close (logic says that too although I am not supposed to use logic). 

# Ta'aluq/Da'wah
## Ikhlaas
Ikhlaas precedes Ta'aluq. Your Ikhlaas should be clear and you should be selfless in your relationships. You shouldn't take unjustified benefits from friends. And absolutely never make friends for the sake of just benefits. 

So, your intentions should be pure. With no ulterior motives.

Relationships can extend to prepare people for a just cause. In those cases, your intentions should be clear as glass. Because now the guilt is combined.

And also don't get demotivated if you don't get want is the ultimate thing.
## Nafsee'at
You should also cater for the psychology of the people around you. You should understand what's going on with the people you want to connect with and find out what's holding them back and what are their strong points.

Also, don't let anger control you.
