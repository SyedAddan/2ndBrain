# 2ndBrain

Welcome to **2ndBrain** – my go-to digital dump for all the random stuff my brain tries (and sometimes fails) to remember. It’s where I store my ideas, notes, tasks, and those “oh, snap!” moments that hit me at 2 AM.

## What’s Inside?

- **Ideas/**: A mix of half-formed concepts, bright moments, and the occasional “what was I thinking?” spark.
- **🚿 Shower Thoughts/**: Epiphanies that hit when I'm scrubbing away the day's stress. They’re as fleeting as shampoo bubbles, but occasionally, they’re pure gold.
- **Actions/**: My to-do lists, because I can’t rely on random sticky notes to keep me organized.
- **Projects/**: Plans for things I’m working on – sometimes brilliant, sometimes just a reminder to fix the leaky sink.
- **Atlas/**: A rough map of my thoughts and knowledge, so I can find my way back when I forget what I was looking for.
- **Life/**: Personal reflections and stories from everyday wins (and epic fails).
- **Thoughts/**: Random musings that sometimes make sense and sometimes just leave me scratching my head.
- **Stoned/**: Those moments of inspiration that hit when I'm not really paying attention.
- **Learn/**: Notes from stuff I’m trying to figure out – proving that even a regular guy can be endlessly curious.

## Why 2ndBrain?

Let's face it: our minds are a bit messy. This repository is my attempt to wrangle that chaos before it vanishes into the abyss of “I’ll think about it later.” It’s here to help me remember the important (and the not-so-important) things that make up my day-to-day life.

## How I Use It

I manage this mess with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), which helps me link thoughts together and keep track of everything. It’s not perfect, but it beats trying to remember everything on my own.
